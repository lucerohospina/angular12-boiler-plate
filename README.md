# Explaining Upgrade Process from AngularJS to Angular 12

## Context

We have to take into account that I have not had access to any specifics about the aplication in AngularJS that needs migration. Meaning, I do not know the size of the application or its design.

## Approach

Just out of my head I would suggest a rewrite of the application. 
We could take this opportunity to upgrade the visual design if possible, giving the application a modern look and feel considering latest angular versions can work with latest versions of UI libraries. 

With the rewrite we can deliver small pieces of the application every sprint and they will be ready for testing. We should have an enviroment ready so potencial users can look around.

## Process Example

* Propose the application architectural design based on an through analysis of the AngularJS application.
* Work the application scaffolding based on an through analysis of the AngularJS application.
* Identify the pieces/sections of the applications so that we can work on them one at a time.
